# simple-api-shiny-app

This repository hosts the shiny app demoed for PSU workshop on APIs. 

IPUMS data can not be re-distributed, so this app takes advantage of new API functionality of `ipumsr` to create a portable yet secure way to share and explore data.
 

In order to run this app, users will need to first register with [IPUMS-USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/menu/). Then contact ipums+api@ipums.org to request to **join the API beta!** Check out [the ipumsr API blog](https://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/articles/ipums-api.html) for detailed steps about setting up API access.
