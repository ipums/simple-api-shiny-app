# simple-api-shiny-app

This repository hosts the shiny app demoed for PSU workshop on API. 

IPUMS data can not be re-distributed, so this app takes advantage of new API functionality of `ipumsr` to create a portable yet secure way to share and explore data.
 

In order to run this app, users will need to first register with [IPUMS-USA]("https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/menu/"). Then contact ipums+api@ipums.org to request to **join the API beta!** Check out [tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/dev/]("https://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/dev/articles/ipums-api.html") for detailed steps about setting up API access.
